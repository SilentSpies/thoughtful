#User Stories: Thoughtful: Be Inspired App#

Thoughtful app is a daily inspiration and social app. New thoughtful quotations are generated daily, along with beautiful photographs (dynamically populated) that are paired with the quotation.  Users are able to create a profile; upload user image; “heart” favorite quotations and photographs; and share either or both favorite quotations and photos across their social media platforms.

We have identified five types of users who would most likely benefit by using the Thoughtful app.

1. New age user - ‘the self helpers’. They are most interested in meaningful quotations. They are interested in minimalist, clean design.
2. Millennials - ‘the sharers’. These are young users who enjoy sharing their favorite quotations and photographs and garnering followers. They require all the social media functionality for the app.
3. Sad/depressed people - ‘those with mental health issues’. These folks look forward to uplifting quotations “and” photographs.  They are not necessarily sharers. They inspire bright colors associated with happiness.
4. Baby Boomers - ’grandparents/those thinking about their mortality’. This group are interested in thoughtful quotations that they share with their grandkids or their social circle on Facebook. This group inspires the typography.
5. Curious - ‘average folks’.  They are most likely to download the app out of curiosity, perhaps use it once or twice.  They don’t inspire any changes in the app.
